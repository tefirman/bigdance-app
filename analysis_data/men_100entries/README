# Analysis Data Directory

This directory contains pre-generated analysis data files that power the bracket assessment functionality. These files are produced by running the bracket_analysis.py script from the bigdance package.

## Required Files

For the full bracket assessment experience, the following files should be placed in this directory:

1. `optimal_upset_strategy.csv` - Contains the optimal number of upsets for each round based on simulation data
2. `champion_pick_comparison.csv` - Compares the frequency of champion picks between winning and non-winning brackets
3. `specific_upset_comparison.csv` - Details on individual upset picks that appear more often in winning brackets
4. `comparative_analysis_summary.md` - A summary report of the analysis findings
5. `upset_comparison_statistics.csv` - Statistical comparisons of upset patterns between winning and non-winning brackets
6. `log_probability_comparison_statistics.csv` - Statistical comparisons of log probabilities between winning and non-winning brackets

## Generating Analysis Data

To generate these files, you can run the bracket_analysis.py script from the bigdance package:

```bash
# First ensure you have bigdance installed
pip install bigdance

# Run the analysis (this may take some time)
python -m bigdance.bracket_analysis --num_pools 100 --output_dir ./analysis_data
```

## Default Values

If any files are missing, the application will use reasonable default values based on historical tournament data, but the recommendations will be less accurate than with the full analysis data.
